This repository contains my project on analyzing employee attrition data and creating an interactive dashboard to answer key HR-related questions. The project aims to help me understand the end-to-end workflow of working with data and presenting actionable insights through a dashboard.

# Project Objective: 
  To analyze HR data and identify the primary reasons for employee attrition, enabling the company to implement strategies to improve retention.

# Data Sourcing:
  The data is taken from drive link shared by Rishabh Mishra (Youtuber) as a part of tutorial of creating a dashboard/project for "data analyst" in his video titled    "Power BI Project End to End | Dashboard | Beginners | Complete Project - 2023".
